# Data Directory

This folder is not tracked in version control because it contains large files
produced during data preparation:

- `output_train/` – per-protein feature CSVs generated by the feature extractor
- `esm2_3B_chain/` – chain-level ESM2 embeddings (`*.pt` files)
- `vectorsTrain_all_chainfix.csv` – merged tabular dataset used by the H5 builder
- `h5/` – transformer-ready datasets created by `run_h5_generation_optimized.sh`

Refer to the main `README.md` for instructions on regenerating these assets.
